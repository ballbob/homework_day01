gitignore

https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

filename.gitignore specifies files for Git to ignore and not track. 

If you include an already-tracked file, it will not be ignored.

Each line instructs git in what to ignore and what not to ignore. These are "patterns" - when committing, ignore ignoreme.txt.

A blank line can be used as a separator.

# begins a comment line.

! at the start of a filename specifies NOT to ignore a file where it would have been by a previous point in the , ie !dontignore.txt
